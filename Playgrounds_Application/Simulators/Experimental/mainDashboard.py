        **Playgrounds Î© Explorer** is designed to give you deeper insight into historical protocol data.
        Using this tool, you can view the historical data for a single or multiple protocol metrics 
        (i.e. RFV growth over time, supply growth,
        or even the current runway).
        
        Have some fun! We can't wait to see the insight you discover!

        **Instructions**
        - **Metrics filter tool**: Use the metrics filter dropdown tool to select the metric/metrics you care about! 
        The chart is designed to scale and accommodate all protocol metrics available! 
        - **Date filter**: In addition to filtering by metrics, you can also filter by time frames. Use the Start/End 
        Date filter to expand or narrow down your time scale
        - **Metrics Visualized**: The chart is an incredibly powerful tool for you to view and analyze your selected
         metric/metrics. Here are some cool things you can do:

            - Hide and view trend lines by clicking on the legend
            - Use the toolbar to access tools such as zoom, pan, data comparison, spike lines, and download
        
        - **Selected Metrics**: For the data table lovers, access your selected metrics in tabular form and download 
        them as CSV!

                    <span style="color:#3E9EF3">**Current APY -** Annual percentage yield (in OHM tokens) 
                    based on the current rebase 
                    rate</span>    
                        This calculation shows 
                        what the APY would be if the current rebase rate remained unchanged while compounding
                         every epoch for one year.
                        As you can see by the graph, the rebase rate does change. It's best to take this value 
                        in consideration with 
                        OIP-18's reward rate framework. And remember, this is yield in OHM!

                    <span style="color:#3E9EF3">**Market Cap -**  Total value of all OHM in circulation</span>  
                        This number is calculated by taking the total number of OHM tokens that exist and multiplying 
                        that by the 
                        current price of one OHM.

                    <span style="color:#3E9EF3">**Next Distribution OHM -**  sOHM tokens to be distributed at the next 
                    rebase</span>    
                        This number is the total amount of sOHM that will be distributed across all current sOHM 
                        holders at the next rebase.
                        This is calculated by taking the total circulating supply of sOHM tokens and multiplying by
                        the rebase percentage.

                    <span style="color:#3E9EF3">**Next Epoch Rebase -**  
                    The percentage by which your staked OHM balance increases on the next 
                    epoch</span>  
                        For example: 1 sOHM with rebase of 0.1% will increase in amount to 1.001 
                        sOHM when the next epoch starts. Each epoch 
                        is roughly 8 hours. The rebase rate is precisely set by the policy team. 
                        Changes to the rate will always be 
                        voted on by the community. The rate is set based on 90% OHM being staked
                         and so can fluctuate slightly based on the 
                        total percentage staked.

                    <span style="color:#3E9EF3">**OHM Circulating Supply -** 
                     The total amount of OHM in circulation</span>  
                        This number does not include OHM controlled by the DAO since it is not in circulation.

                    <span style="color:#3E9EF3">**sOHM Circulating Supply -**  
                    The total amount of sOHM in circulation</span>  
                        When you stake OHM, you lock that OHM in the protocol and receive an equal amount of sOHM. 
                        This metric is 
                        the total number of sOHM, but also can be viewed as the amount of OHM that has been locked
                         into the protocol via staking.

                    <span style="color:#3E9EF3">**OHM Price -**  The price in USD for one OHM</span>  
                        This is the trading or exchange price for one OHM as compared to USD.

                    <span style="color:#3E9EF3">**Runway Current -**  
                    Number of days sOHM emissions can be sustained at the current rebase 
                    rate if all protocol income ceased</span>  
                        Runway is calculated using the current risk-free value (RFV) in the treasury.

                    <span style="color:#3E9EF3">**Total Value Locked -**  
                    Value in USD of all OHM staked in the protocol</span>  
                        This metric is often used as growth or health indicator in DeFi projects. 
                        These are the funds that the protocol can 
                        use to earn revenue through providing liquidity and other means.

                    <span style="color:#3E9EF3">**Treasury Market Value -** 
                     Value in USD of treasury assets if sold on the open market</span>  
                        Treasury Market Value, is the the value in USD of all assets held by the treasury.
                         This value becomes more relevant 
                        as OHM becomes backed by more diverse assets other than pegged stable coins. 

                    <span style="color:#3E9EF3">**Treasury Risk Free Value -** Value in USD of stable
                     coin assets in the treasury</span>  
                        Treasury Risk Free Value, is the amount of funds the treasury holds in stable coins.
                         The term "risk free" means that 
                        these assets do not have market values that fluctuate. They are pegged to $1 USD and 
                        are guaranteed so long as these 
                        stable coins remain _stable_.
